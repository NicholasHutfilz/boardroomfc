## Why?

* **Open and Transparent**: Built in the open â€” no annual cash grabs, no locked-away mechanics.
* **AI-Driven Simulation**: Every manager, player, and club acts with individual goals and motivations.
* **Frustration-Free**: We're addressing years of Football Manager gripes: broken AI, static systems, and corporate bloat.
* **Community First**: Built to be modded, forked, reshaped â€” whatever the community needs.

## Features (Early)

* Save and user system via Supabase
* SQLite-based game saves stored in Cloudflare buckets
* API-driven architecture connecting save logic to frontend
* Conversation UI system (e.g. job interviews, agent negotiations)
* Transparent contract negotiation system with wage/bonus editing
* Open-source trailer demos in development

## Project Structure

* `app/` â€“ Main Next.js frontend application
* `lib/` â€“ Shared API logic and utilities
* `data/` â€“ SQLite and game save storage utilities
* `api/` â€“ Server routes (in development) to interact with game state
* `public/` â€“ Assets (favicon, etc.)
